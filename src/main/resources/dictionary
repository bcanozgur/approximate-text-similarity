Abstract— Today, along with technological developments,
mobile devices are used in areas where personal data is
important such as banking, social media and communication. It
is very important for mobile device users whether applications
developed for Android or IOS operating systems, contain
malicious software or malicious code. To detect these types of
weakness, security analysts run mobile penetration tests using
analysis tools. While these analysis tools outperform each other
in various areas, they lag behind each other in some areas, there
is no model exists to gather these tools in a framework. Within
the scope of the current model, we are aimed to present security
analysis tools under one penetration testing framework to
security analysts who make security analyzes of mobile
applications by the advantage of fusion algorithm. With the
suggested model, security analysts will be able to access the
security analysis tools independently on the type of analysis also
use advantage of fusion algorithm fed from analysis tools
outputs.
